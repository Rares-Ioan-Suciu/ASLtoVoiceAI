# ✋ Hand Gesture to Speech Translator

A computer vision-based Python application that translates real-time hand gestures (ASL letters) into English text and then speaks the resulting sentence aloud using a text-to-speech engine.

## 🚀 Features

- 🤚 Real-time ASL alphabet recognition using MediaPipe.
- 🧠 Machine learning model trained to classify 26 English letters and control gestures (`1 = Space`, `5 = Backspace`).
- 🧼 Noise filtering when no hand is detected.
- 🔈 Text-to-speech support via Google Text-to-Speech (gTTS) and `pygame`.
- ✨ Automatically speaks the full sentence when no hand is detected for a few seconds.

## 🛠 Requirements

Install the required Python packages:

```bash
pip install opencv-python mediapipe scikit-learn gTTS pygame
```
Or use:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


# 🔍 How It Works

### 🖐️ Hand Detection
MediaPipe detects **hand landmarks** (21 key points).

### 📈 Feature Extraction
Extracts **relative coordinates** of landmarks for model input.

### 🔮 Prediction
A trained **classifier** predicts the letter or gesture.

### 🧩 Sentence Formation
Stabilized letters form a sentence, with special gestures for:
- **1** → Space  
- **5** → Backspace

### 🔊 Speech Output
When **no hand** is detected for a short period, the **sentence is spoken aloud**.

## 🧠 Training the Model (Optional)

If you want to train your own model:

1. **Collect data** using your webcam and save **landmark data** for each letter.
2. **Train a classifier** (e.g. RandomForest) on the dataset.
3. **Save it** as `model.p` using `pickle`.

## 🎮 Controls & Gestures

| Gesture | Action        |
|---------|---------------|
| A–Z     | Add letter    |
| 1       | Add space     |
| 5       | Backspace     |
| No hand | Speak sentence |
